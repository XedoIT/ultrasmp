#   THE ID MUST BE GREATER THAN 0 AND IT MUST BE UNIQUE. A NEW ID IS A COMPLETELY NEW REWARD               #
#   The rewards in the database are identified by IDs. Let's say a player has obtained a reward            #
#   called rankup which has the ID of 1. If the ID gets changed to let's say 2, the player will once       #
#   again receive the rankup reward.                                                                       #
#   No two rewards should have the same ID                                                                 #
