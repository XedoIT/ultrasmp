# When customizing the messages, you can use placeholders.                                #
# For instance, %hours% will get replaced by the amount of hours player has played for    #
# Available placeholders:                                                                 #
#   %target% -> this is the target's username                                             #
#   The following time placeholders will display the units in clock format rather than    #
#   their total                                                                           #
#   %hours%                                                                               #
#   %minutes                                                                              #
#   %seconds%                                                                             #
#   %reward% -> this is the reward's name                                                 #
# All time settings are in seconds                                                        #
